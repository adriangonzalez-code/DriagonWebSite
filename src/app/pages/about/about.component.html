    <p>Hey there! Iâ€™m Adrian Gonzalez, but in the tech universe, people call me <strong>Driagon</strong>. Why? Because I tackle backend challenges with the fire and determination of a dragonâ€”always ready to turn problems into elegant solutions.</p>
    <p>With 6+ years of experience, Iâ€™ve specialized in building robust APIs and microservices using <strong>Java & Spring Boot</strong>. Iâ€™m passionate about leveraging the Spring ecosystemâ€”Spring Cloud, Spring Data JPA, Spring Data Mongo, Spring Security, Actuator, and moreâ€”to create scalable, secure, and efficient systems.</p>
    <p>I enjoy transforming complex requirements into clean, production-ready code, and Iâ€™m always eager to automate, share knowledge, and make teamwork as smooth as well-written code.</p>
    <p>In short: Iâ€™m the backend developer who turns challenges into opportunities and bugs into success stories. ðŸš€</p>
